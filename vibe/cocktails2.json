The Picante de la Casa Cocktail, also called the Soho House Picante or Soho House Tonic, is a creation of the Soho House Club. That is a group of private members' clubs with its origin in Soho in the Londoner West End. The cocktail, however, does not have its roots in England but in West Hollywood, USA. -Although, actually, it looks like it could be straight out of Mexico.\n\nSoho House have shared the recipe for their picante de la casa. The picante is based on the much-loved margarita, but the picante cocktail ingredients includes chilli and coriander – to add a little extra heat and spice. It is revelatory – and a drink you’ll be coming back to.",

It is sweeter than sugar, so smaller amounts can be used to achieve the same level of sweetness. Additionally, it has a lower glycemic index compared to some other sweeteners, meaning it has a smaller impact on blood sugar levels.\n\nAgave syrup has a mild, neutral flavor, making it suitable for a variety of culinary applications. It is commonly used as a sweetener in beverages, baked goods, and desserts. However, it's essential to note that agave syrup, like any sweetener, should be consumed in moderation due to its high fructose content.",

It falls under the category of distilled spirits and is known for its diverse and complex flavor profile, which can include herbal, floral, citrus, and spicy notes. The production of gin involves distilling a neutral spirit with botanicals, with juniper being the key botanical required for a spirit to be classified as gin.\n\nThe defining characteristic of gin is the prominent presence of juniper berries in its flavor profile. The name \"gin\" is derived from the French word \"genièvre,\" meaning juniper.\n\nThere are several styles of gin, including London Dry Gin, Plymouth Gin, and New Western or Contemporary-style Gin. Each style has its own production methods and regulations.\n\nGin has a long history and has evolved over centuries, becoming one of the most popular and beloved spirits globally. Its association with a wide array of cocktails makes it a staple in bars and households alike.",

It's a key ingredient in classics like the Tom Collins, where it complements the gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup by adding a sparkling finish. It is also essential in making a Highball, where it dilutes the whiskey and adds a refreshing effervescence, or in a Mojito, where it lightens the mixture of rum, mint, lime, and sugar.\n\nClub soda is preferred over other carbonated waters like tonic water or seltzer when the goal is to add carbonation without additional flavors. Its clean, neutral taste makes it an ideal mixer for a wide range of cocktails, contributing to the drink’s texture and mouthfeel without overshadowing the primary ingredients.",

Sugar cubes are a key component in classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned, where they are soaked in bitters before being muddled to release their sweetness.\n\nBeyond its role as a sweetener, sugar can also influence the texture and mouthfeel of a cocktail, adding a slight viscosity that enhances the drink's overall experience.

    "description": "The cocktail first became popular among the youth of the college town of Córdoba, in the 1980s and—impulsed by an advertising campaign led by Fratelli Branca—its consumption grew in popularity during the following decades to become widespread throughout the country, surpassed only by that of beer and wine. It is now considered a cultural icon of Argentina and is especially associated with its home province of Córdoba, where the drink is most consumed. The popularity of fernet con coca is such that Argentina consumes more than 75% of all fernet produced globally. The cocktail can also be found in some of its bordering countries, like Uruguay.\n\nAlthough typically made with Fernet-Branca and Coca-Cola, several amaro brands have appeared in Argentina since its popularization, as well as ready-to-drink versions.",

    "description": "Tony Abou-Ganim, also known as The Modern Mixologist, is a bartending legend that co-founded the Starlight Room. He created the Cable Car cocktail to pay tribute to San Francisco's cable cars! The cable cars of San Francisco are an icon of a past era. They still climb the hills of San Francisco and carry commuters and tourists up and down busy streets.\n\nThis rum sour is sweet, tart, and lightly spiced, regardless of whether you are familiar with its name. The Cable Car cocktail is a modified Sidecar. It substitutes brandy with spiced rum, back then, spiced rum was very uncommon.\n\nAbou-Ganim's original cocktails helped to establish San Francisco as a cocktail destination in an era that was defined by Cosmopolitan and other similar drinks.\n\nCaptain Morgan was probably the most widely available spiced rum label at the time of Cable Car's inception. The Captain is probably still the most well-known of the category, but today there are plenty of other options. A more luxurious approach is to maybe use something like a Boukman Botanical Rhum.\n\nSimilar to a Sidecar or Brandy Crusta, the Cable Car includes an orange liqueur in addition to simple syrup for sweetness--specifically, orange curacao. using Bol's or something similar can make the drink heavy, so it's better to use a dry curacao. Abou-Ganim uses Marie Brizard Orange Curacao in the original recipe. Grand Marnier or maybe Cointreau would also work great.\n\nAnother aspect that made the Cable Car a classic is the way it was presented. Abou-Ganim uses a mixture of cinnamon and sugar to give the drink a punchier sweetness and a present hint of spice.",

The process of making brandy involves fermenting the fruit sugars into alcohol and then distilling the resulting liquid to increase its alcohol content. After distillation, brandy is often aged in wooden barrels, which contributes to its flavor, color, and aroma.\n\nThere are a few types of brandy:\n\n- V.S. (\"very special\") or ✯✯✯ (three stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy has been stored for at least two years in a cask.\n- V.S.O.P. (\"very superior old pale\"), Reserve or ✯✯✯✯✯ (five stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least four years in a cask.\n- XO (\"extra old\") or Napoléon designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least six years.\n- Hors d'âge ('beyond age') is a designation formally equal to XO for Cognac, but for Armagnac it designates brandy that is at least ten years old. In practice, the term is used by producers to market a high-quality product beyond the official age scale.\n\nBrandy has a rich history and is produced in many regions around the world, each with its own traditions and methods.

It is typically green in color, but clear variations also exist. Absinthe is renowned for its distinctive herbal and botanical profile, which often includes ingredients like wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), anise, fennel, and other herbs.\n\nThe production of absinthe involves macerating and distilling these botanicals to create a highly concentrated liquid. The key component, wormwood, was once believed to contain a compound called thujone, thought to induce hallucinations. However, modern absinthes are produced with strict regulations regarding thujone content, and the hallucinogenic effects of traditional absinthe are now considered to be largely exaggerated.\n\nAbsinthe is often served by diluting it with water, typically by pouring cold water over a sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon, which is then held over the glass. This process, known as the \"louche,\" causes the absinthe to cloud and release its herbal flavors.\n\nThe drink gained notoriety in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the bohemian and artistic communities of Europe. It was banned in many countries for a period due to concerns about its alleged psychoactive effects and its association with absinthe-induced madness. However, the ban has been lifted in most places, and today absinthe is produced and consumed legally with regulated thujone levels.\n\nAbsinthe has experienced a resurgence in popularity, and while its reputation as a mind-altering substance has been debunked, it is still enjoyed for its unique flavor and the ritualistic manner in which it is often served.",

It falls under the category of distilled spirits and is known for its diverse and complex flavor profile, which can include herbal, floral, citrus, and spicy notes. The production of gin involves distilling a neutral spirit with botanicals, with juniper being the key botanical required for a spirit to be classified as gin.\n\nThe defining characteristic of gin is the prominent presence of juniper berries in its flavor profile. The name \"gin\" is derived from the French word \"genièvre,\" meaning juniper.\n\nThere are several styles of gin, including London Dry Gin, Plymouth Gin, and New Western or Contemporary-style Gin. Each style has its own production methods and regulations.\n\nGin has a long history and has evolved over centuries, becoming one of the most popular and beloved spirits globally.

It was one of those drinks that was so unpopular that nobody that I know even tried to make it work, like you can do with so many of those forgotten ‘classics,’ ” says Amberg. “With a few adjustments we stumbled upon something truly delicious.”",

To be labeled as rye whiskey in the United States, the mash (grain mixture fermented to make alcohol) must be composed of at least 51% rye. The remaining ingredients in the mash can include other grains such as corn and barley. Rye whiskey is aged in new charred oak barrels, and the final product must be distilled to no more than 160 proof and entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof.\n\nAmerican rye whiskey tends to have a spicier and more robust flavor profile compared to bourbon, which is primarily made from corn.\n\nIn Canada, the term \"rye\" is often used broadly and doesn't necessarily mean that the whiskey is made predominantly from rye grain. Canadian rye whisky can contain a mix of grains, and the flavor profile may vary. Some Canadian whiskies labeled as \"rye\" are made with little or no rye content.\n\nRye whiskey is known for its distinctive taste, which can include spicy, fruity, and sometimes peppery notes. It can be enjoyed neat, on the rocks, or used in various cocktails such as the classic Manhattan or Old Fashioned.",

Which, was a good move. But then, four years later [1927], he puts out the book &amp;quot;Barflies and Cocktails&amp;quot; and includes the White Lady, but the recipe no longer had gin. It went back to cremé de menthe, and it didn&amp;#039;t have lemon juice. It had Brandy, and it was no longer equal parts. It was a completely different drink.\n\nBut then, 3 years later, in 1930, Harry Craddock steps in and he puts, in the &amp;quot;The Savoy Cocktail Book&amp;quot;, the White Lady. Gin, triple sec and lemon juice, only he increases the amount of gin to make a drier cocktail. Which is pretty much the cocktail we have today... and it&amp;#039;s a great drink.\n\nA few years after this drink became popular at the American Bar at the Savoy in London, because of Harry Craddock.

        "description": "Absinthe is a highly alcoholic and anise-flavored spirit that is historically known for its association with bohemian culture and its supposed hallucinogenic properties. It is typically green in color, but clear variations also exist. Absinthe is renowned for its distinctive herbal and botanical profile, which often includes ingredients like wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), anise, fennel, and other herbs.\n\nThe production of absinthe involves macerating and distilling these botanicals to create a highly concentrated liquid. The key component, wormwood, was once believed to contain a compound called thujone, thought to induce hallucinations. However, modern absinthes are produced with strict regulations regarding thujone content, and the hallucinogenic effects of traditional absinthe are now considered to be largely exaggerated.\n\nAbsinthe is often served by diluting it with water, typically by pouring cold water over a sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon, which is then held over the glass. This process, known as the \"louche,\" causes the absinthe to cloud and release its herbal flavors.\n\nThe drink gained notoriety in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the bohemian and artistic communities of Europe. It was banned in many countries for a period due to concerns about its alleged psychoactive effects and its association with absinthe-induced madness. However, the ban has been lifted in most places, and today absinthe is produced and consumed legally with regulated thujone levels.\n\nAbsinthe has experienced a resurgence in popularity, and while its reputation as a mind-altering substance has been debunked, it is still enjoyed for its unique flavor and the ritualistic manner in which it is often served.",

        "description": "Sugar is a fundamental ingredient in cocktails, used primarily as a sweetener to balance the flavors of sour, bitter, or strong alcoholic components. It comes in various forms, including granulated sugar, superfine sugar, and sugar cubes, each of which can be used differently depending on the cocktail. Sugar can also be transformed into simple syrup, a liquid form that dissolves easily in cold beverages, making it a versatile option for many drinks.\n\nIn cocktails, sugar is often used to rim glasses, such as in a classic Margarita or a Sidecar, where the rim is coated with sugar to add sweetness with every sip. Superfine sugar is preferred for drinks like the Daiquiri or the Mojito, where it is muddled with lime or mint to create a balanced and refreshing flavor. Sugar cubes are a key component in classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned, where they are soaked in bitters before being muddled to release their sweetness.\n\nBeyond its role as a sweetener, sugar can also influence the texture and mouthfeel of a cocktail, adding a slight viscosity that enhances the drink's overall experience. Whether used in its solid form or as a syrup, sugar is an essential ingredient that helps create harmony and depth in a wide range of cocktails.",

You take a sip. Crisp. Cold. Tropical. Revitalizing. This is that drink.\n\nChartreuse is the dominant flavor, trailed by a comforting whisper of coconut aroma and the grassy & clean Copalli rum. When recreating, your choice of coconut rum will be pivotal in how the drink turns out; the best coconut rum I can recommend is the Hawaiian-made Koloa rum. More info on this rum can be found here but in short, it’s a fresh, natural, actual RUM that is scented with coconut and not a coconut LIQUEUR like many cloyingly sweet “coconut rums” tend to be.\n\nThis is dangerously easy-drinking for what it is, imbibe responsibly. Chartreuse = 55% Copalli rum = 42%. Koloa coconut rum = 40%.",

        "description": "Absinthe is a highly alcoholic and anise-flavored spirit that is historically known for its association with bohemian culture and its supposed hallucinogenic properties. It is typically green in color, but clear variations also exist. Absinthe is renowned for its distinctive herbal and botanical profile, which often includes ingredients like wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), anise, fennel, and other herbs.\n\nThe production of absinthe involves macerating and distilling these botanicals to create a highly concentrated liquid. The key component, wormwood, was once believed to contain a compound called thujone, thought to induce hallucinations. However, modern absinthes are produced with strict regulations regarding thujone content, and the hallucinogenic effects of traditional absinthe are now considered to be largely exaggerated.\n\nAbsinthe is often served by diluting it with water, typically by pouring cold water over a sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon, which is then held over the glass. This process, known as the \"louche,\" causes the absinthe to cloud and release its herbal flavors.\n\nThe drink gained notoriety in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the bohemian and artistic communities of Europe. It was banned in many countries for a period due to concerns about its alleged psychoactive effects and its association with absinthe-induced madness. However, the ban has been lifted in most places, and today absinthe is produced and consumed legally with regulated thujone levels.\n\nAbsinthe has experienced a resurgence in popularity, and while its reputation as a mind-altering substance has been debunked, it is still enjoyed for its unique flavor and the ritualistic manner in which it is often served.",

Sugar can also be transformed into simple syrup, a liquid form that dissolves easily in cold beverages, making it a versatile option for many drinks.\n\nIn cocktails, sugar is often used to rim glasses, such as in a classic Margarita or a Sidecar, where the rim is coated with sugar to add sweetness with every sip. Superfine sugar is preferred for drinks like the Daiquiri or the Mojito, where it is muddled with lime or mint to create a balanced and refreshing flavor. Sugar cubes are a key component in classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned, where they are soaked in bitters before being muddled to release their sweetness.\n\nBeyond its role as a sweetener, sugar can also influence the texture and mouthfeel of a cocktail, adding a slight viscosity that enhances the drink's overall experience.

It comes in various forms, including granulated sugar, superfine sugar, and sugar cubes, each of which can be used differently depending on the cocktail. Sugar can also be transformed into simple syrup, a liquid form that dissolves easily in cold beverages, making it a versatile option for many drinks.\n\nIn cocktails, sugar is often used to rim glasses, such as in a classic Margarita or a Sidecar, where the rim is coated with sugar to add sweetness with every sip. Superfine sugar is preferred for drinks like the Daiquiri or the Mojito, where it is muddled with lime or mint to create a balanced and refreshing flavor. Sugar cubes are a key component in classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned, where they are soaked in bitters before being muddled to release their sweetness.\n\nBeyond its role as a sweetener, sugar can also influence the texture and mouthfeel of a cocktail, adding a slight viscosity that enhances the drink's overall experience.

The resulting liquid is then sweetened with sugar, and sometimes flavored with vanilla or other spices.\n\nAmaretto is often enjoyed on its own as a digestif or as an ingredient in various cocktails and culinary recipes.

This means that the bourbon is presented to consumers at its natural, undiluted alcohol strength, as it was when it matured in the barrel.\n\nWhen bourbon is aging in barrels, it undergoes changes in flavor and character as it interacts with the wood and other compounds present in the cask. Cask strength bourbon captures the full intensity of these flavors without the addition of water to lower the alcohol content.\n\nThe alcohol by volume (ABV) of cask-strength bourbon can be significantly higher than standard bottlings, often ranging from 110 proof (55% ABV) to well over 130 proof (65% ABV) or more. This higher proof can intensify the flavors and provide a more robust and concentrated drinking experience.\n\nCask-strength bourbons have gained popularity among whiskey enthusiasts who appreciate the opportunity to experience the full, unaltered expression of the bourbon as it was intended by the distiller. Some bourbon brands release limited-edition cask-strength bottlings, and these releases can be highly sought after by collectors and connoisseurs. When enjoying cask-strength bourbon, it is not uncommon for individuals to add a splash of water to their glass to personalize the drinking experience and open up additional flavors.",

        "description": "Absinthe is a highly alcoholic and anise-flavored spirit that is historically known for its association with bohemian culture and its supposed hallucinogenic properties. It is typically green in color, but clear variations also exist. Absinthe is renowned for its distinctive herbal and botanical profile, which often includes ingredients like wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), anise, fennel, and other herbs.\n\nThe production of absinthe involves macerating and distilling these botanicals to create a highly concentrated liquid. The key component, wormwood, was once believed to contain a compound called thujone, thought to induce hallucinations. However, modern absinthes are produced with strict regulations regarding thujone content, and the hallucinogenic effects of traditional absinthe are now considered to be largely exaggerated.\n\nAbsinthe is often served by diluting it with water, typically by pouring cold water over a sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon, which is then held over the glass. This process, known as the \"louche,\" causes the absinthe to cloud and release its herbal flavors.\n\nThe drink gained notoriety in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the bohemian and artistic communities of Europe. It was banned in many countries for a period due to concerns about its alleged psychoactive effects and its association with absinthe-induced madness. However, the ban has been lifted in most places, and today absinthe is produced and consumed legally with regulated thujone levels.\n\nAbsinthe has experienced a resurgence in popularity, and while its reputation as a mind-altering substance has been debunked, it is still enjoyed for its unique flavor and the ritualistic manner in which it is often served.",

        "description": "Mezcal is a distilled alcoholic beverage that originates from Mexico, known for its distinctive smoky flavor. It is made from the agave plant, primarily the species Agave espadin, although other agave varieties can be used. The production of mezcal involves roasting the agave hearts (piñas) in underground pits, which imparts a smoky character to the final product. After roasting, the agave is crushed, fermented, and then distilled, resulting in a spirit with a wide range of flavors, including earthy, fruity, and herbal notes.\n\nThe traditional production methods involve cooking the agave in earthen pits lined with lava rocks and filled with wood and charcoal. This underground roasting process gives mezcal its distinctive smoky taste.\n\nMezcal is produced in specific regions of Mexico, with Oaxaca being a particularly renowned area for its high-quality mezcals. The production of mezcal is regulated, and the spirit has a Denomination of Origin (DO) to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\nUnlike some other agave spirits, such as tequila, which is made from Blue Agave, mezcal can be produced from a variety of agave types, contributing to the spirit's diversity.\n\nMezcal is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has gained international recognition for its artisanal production methods and diverse flavor profile.",

It is made from the agave plant, primarily the species Agave espadin, although other agave varieties can be used.

After roasting, the agave is crushed, fermented, and then distilled, resulting in a spirit with a wide range of flavors, including earthy, fruity, and herbal notes.\n\nThe traditional production methods involve cooking the agave in earthen pits lined with lava rocks and filled with wood and charcoal. This underground roasting process gives mezcal its distinctive smoky taste.\n\nMezcal is produced in specific regions of Mexico, with Oaxaca being a particularly renowned area for its high-quality mezcals. The production of mezcal is regulated, and the spirit has a Denomination of Origin (DO) to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\nUnlike some other agave spirits, such as tequila, which is made from Blue Agave, mezcal can be produced from a variety of agave types, contributing to the spirit's diversity.\n\nMezcal is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has gained international recognition for its artisanal production methods and diverse flavor profile.",

The crowning touch? Bramble ages its mixture in barrels; they originally used small casks custom-made for the cocktails by Glenmorangie and are currently using 50-liter barrels that previously held oloroso sherry, aging the cocktail for between three and nine months and using a solera system for consistency. Until you can get to Edinburgh to try one of Bramble’s barrel-aged Affinity cocktails in person, here’s the base recipe, which should give you a delicious taste of the possibilities.",

After roasting, the agave is crushed, fermented, and then distilled, resulting in a spirit with a wide range of flavors, including earthy, fruity, and herbal notes.\n\nThe traditional production methods involve cooking the agave in earthen pits lined with lava rocks and filled with wood and charcoal. This underground roasting process gives mezcal its distinctive smoky taste.\n\nMezcal is produced in specific regions of Mexico, with Oaxaca being a particularly renowned area for its high-quality mezcals. The production of mezcal is regulated, and the spirit has a Denomination of Origin (DO) to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\nUnlike some other agave spirits, such as tequila, which is made from Blue Agave, mezcal can be produced from a variety of agave types, contributing to the spirit's diversity.\n\nMezcal is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has gained international recognition for its artisanal production methods and diverse flavor profile.",

A simple mix of spirits, sugar, bitters and water, it appears in 1806 as the first printed recipe for a cocktail (“cock tail”). Other alcohols were permitted, but the whiskey or rye version of this combination, over ice, is what we now know as the Old Fashioned, thought to be named later that century after more elaborate new-fangled cocktails entered the canon. During Prohibition, the recipe veered into odd territory, adding fruit and cherries to distract from the available crude spirits.

Superfine sugar is preferred for drinks like the Daiquiri or the Mojito, where it is muddled with lime or mint to create a balanced and refreshing flavor. Sugar cubes are a key component in classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned, where they are soaked in bitters before being muddled to release their sweetness.\n\nBeyond its role as a sweetener, sugar can also influence the texture and mouthfeel of a cocktail, adding a slight viscosity that enhances the drink's overall experience.

It is also essential in making a Highball, where it dilutes the whiskey and adds a refreshing effervescence, or in a Mojito, where it lightens the mixture of rum, mint, lime, and sugar.\n\nClub soda is preferred over other carbonated waters like tonic water or seltzer when the goal is to add carbonation without additional flavors.

The alcohol content typically ranges between 14% and 20%.\n\nIn cocktails, sake is often used as a base spirit or a modifier, bringing a subtle, smooth flavor that complements other ingredients without overpowering them. Its versatility allows it to pair well with a variety of flavors, from citrus and fruit to herbs and spices. Sake-based cocktails, like the Sake Martini or the Tokyo Mule, often emphasize its lightness and delicate flavor, making them ideal for those seeking a refined and refreshing drink.\n\nSake can also be enjoyed on its own, either chilled, at room temperature, or warm, depending on the type and the occasion. It is traditionally served in small ceramic cups and is an integral part of Japanese cuisine and culture.

        "description": "Sugar is a fundamental ingredient in cocktails, used primarily as a sweetener to balance the flavors of sour, bitter, or strong alcoholic components. It comes in various forms, including granulated sugar, superfine sugar, and sugar cubes, each of which can be used differently depending on the cocktail. Sugar can also be transformed into simple syrup, a liquid form that dissolves easily in cold beverages, making it a versatile option for many drinks.\n\nIn cocktails, sugar is often used to rim glasses, such as in a classic Margarita or a Sidecar, where the rim is coated with sugar to add sweetness with every sip. Superfine sugar is preferred for drinks like the Daiquiri or the Mojito, where it is muddled with lime or mint to create a balanced and refreshing flavor. Sugar cubes are a key component in classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned, where they are soaked in bitters before being muddled to release their sweetness.\n\nBeyond its role as a sweetener, sugar can also influence the texture and mouthfeel of a cocktail, adding a slight viscosity that enhances the drink's overall experience. Whether used in its solid form or as a syrup, sugar is an essential ingredient that helps create harmony and depth in a wide range of cocktails.",

It is typically green in color, but clear variations also exist. Absinthe is renowned for its distinctive herbal and botanical profile, which often includes ingredients like wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), anise, fennel, and other herbs.\n\nThe production of absinthe involves macerating and distilling these botanicals to create a highly concentrated liquid. The key component, wormwood, was once believed to contain a compound called thujone, thought to induce hallucinations. However, modern absinthes are produced with strict regulations regarding thujone content, and the hallucinogenic effects of traditional absinthe are now considered to be largely exaggerated.\n\nAbsinthe is often served by diluting it with water, typically by pouring cold water over a sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon, which is then held over the glass. This process, known as the \"louche,\" causes the absinthe to cloud and release its herbal flavors.\n\nThe drink gained notoriety in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the bohemian and artistic communities of Europe. It was banned in many countries for a period due to concerns about its alleged psychoactive effects and its association with absinthe-induced madness. However, the ban has been lifted in most places, and today absinthe is produced and consumed legally with regulated thujone levels.\n\nAbsinthe has experienced a resurgence in popularity, and while its reputation as a mind-altering substance has been debunked, it is still enjoyed for its unique flavor and the ritualistic manner in which it is often served.",

In practice, the term is used by producers to market a high-quality product beyond the official age scale.\n\nBrandy has a rich history and is produced in many regions around the world, each with its own traditions and methods.

Some sources indicate that the name derives from that of an American gangster active during Prohibition; less likely the dedication to Rick Blaine, the protagonist of Casablanca played by Humphrey Bogart, as the film follows the first testimonies (1942).",

Made by diluting honey with water, usually in a 1:1 ratio, this syrup brings not only sweetness but also subtle floral, herbal, or fruity notes depending on the type of honey used.\n\nWhen incorporating honey syrup into drinks, it's important to consider its distinct flavor profile. The type of honey used can significantly impact the final taste of the cocktail, allowing for creative variations. Bartenders often prefer to make their own honey syrup to control the consistency and flavor, though commercial versions are available. As with other syrups, the amount used can be adjusted to balance the cocktail's sweetness with other components.",

It is typically green in color, but clear variations also exist. Absinthe is renowned for its distinctive herbal and botanical profile, which often includes ingredients like wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), anise, fennel, and other herbs.\n\nThe production of absinthe involves macerating and distilling these botanicals to create a highly concentrated liquid. The key component, wormwood, was once believed to contain a compound called thujone, thought to induce hallucinations. However, modern absinthes are produced with strict regulations regarding thujone content, and the hallucinogenic effects of traditional absinthe are now considered to be largely exaggerated.\n\nAbsinthe is often served by diluting it with water, typically by pouring cold water over a sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon, which is then held over the glass. This process, known as the \"louche,\" causes the absinthe to cloud and release its herbal flavors.\n\nThe drink gained notoriety in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the bohemian and artistic communities of Europe. It was banned in many countries for a period due to concerns about its alleged psychoactive effects and its association with absinthe-induced madness. However, the ban has been lifted in most places, and today absinthe is produced and consumed legally with regulated thujone levels.\n\nAbsinthe has experienced a resurgence in popularity, and while its reputation as a mind-altering substance has been debunked, it is still enjoyed for its unique flavor and the ritualistic manner in which it is often served.",

It comes in various forms, including granulated sugar, superfine sugar, and sugar cubes, each of which can be used differently depending on the cocktail. Sugar can also be transformed into simple syrup, a liquid form that dissolves easily in cold beverages, making it a versatile option for many drinks.\n\nIn cocktails, sugar is often used to rim glasses, such as in a classic Margarita or a Sidecar, where the rim is coated with sugar to add sweetness with every sip. Superfine sugar is preferred for drinks like the Daiquiri or the Mojito, where it is muddled with lime or mint to create a balanced and refreshing flavor. Sugar cubes are a key component in classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned, where they are soaked in bitters before being muddled to release their sweetness.\n\nBeyond its role as a sweetener, sugar can also influence the texture and mouthfeel of a cocktail, adding a slight viscosity that enhances the drink's overall experience.

Its natural bitterness and acidity make it an excellent counterpoint to sweet liqueurs and spirits, creating well-balanced drinks. The juice also contributes a lovely pink or ruby hue to cocktails, enhancing their visual appeal.\nPopular in classics like the Paloma and the Greyhound, grapefruit juice pairs particularly well with tequila, vodka, and gin. When using grapefruit juice in cocktails, freshly squeezed is ideal for the brightest flavor, though high-quality bottled juices can be a convenient alternative. The amount used can vary, but its strong flavor means a little often goes a long way in cocktail recipes.",

It is made from the agave plant, primarily the species Agave espadin, although other agave varieties can be used. The production of mezcal involves roasting the agave hearts (piñas) in underground pits, which imparts a smoky character to the final product. After roasting, the agave is crushed, fermented, and then distilled, resulting in a spirit with a wide range of flavors, including earthy, fruity, and herbal notes.\n\nThe traditional production methods involve cooking the agave in earthen pits lined with lava rocks and filled with wood and charcoal. This underground roasting process gives mezcal its distinctive smoky taste.\n\nMezcal is produced in specific regions of Mexico, with Oaxaca being a particularly renowned area for its high-quality mezcals. The production of mezcal is regulated, and the spirit has a Denomination of Origin (DO) to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\nUnlike some other agave spirits, such as tequila, which is made from Blue Agave, mezcal can be produced from a variety of agave types, contributing to the spirit's diversity.\n\nMezcal is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has gained international recognition for its artisanal production methods and diverse flavor profile.",

        "description": "Absinthe is a highly alcoholic and anise-flavored spirit that is historically known for its association with bohemian culture and its supposed hallucinogenic properties. It is typically green in color, but clear variations also exist. Absinthe is renowned for its distinctive herbal and botanical profile, which often includes ingredients like wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), anise, fennel, and other herbs.\n\nThe production of absinthe involves macerating and distilling these botanicals to create a highly concentrated liquid. The key component, wormwood, was once believed to contain a compound called thujone, thought to induce hallucinations. However, modern absinthes are produced with strict regulations regarding thujone content, and the hallucinogenic effects of traditional absinthe are now considered to be largely exaggerated.\n\nAbsinthe is often served by diluting it with water, typically by pouring cold water over a sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon, which is then held over the glass. This process, known as the \"louche,\" causes the absinthe to cloud and release its herbal flavors.\n\nThe drink gained notoriety in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the bohemian and artistic communities of Europe. It was banned in many countries for a period due to concerns about its alleged psychoactive effects and its association with absinthe-induced madness. However, the ban has been lifted in most places, and today absinthe is produced and consumed legally with regulated thujone levels.\n\nAbsinthe has experienced a resurgence in popularity, and while its reputation as a mind-altering substance has been debunked, it is still enjoyed for its unique flavor and the ritualistic manner in which it is often served.",

        "description": "Orgeat syrup is a sweet, nutty syrup that plays a crucial role in many classic and tiki-style cocktails. Traditionally made from almonds, sugar, and orange flower water, orgeat has a distinctive flavor profile that combines nuttiness with subtle floral notes and a rich sweetness.\n\n\nIn cocktails, orgeat syrup adds depth, complexity, and a silky texture. Its unique taste complements a wide range of spirits, particularly rum and whiskey, and it's an essential ingredient in iconic drinks like the Mai Tai and the Japanese Cocktail. The syrup's ability to smooth out harsh edges in spirits while adding its own character makes it a valuable tool in a mixologist's arsenal.\n\n\nWhen using orgeat syrup, a little goes a long way due to its concentrated flavor and sweetness. High-quality commercial versions are readily available, but some bartenders prefer to make their own to control the flavor profile and ingredients. While almond is the traditional base, variations using other nuts like pistachio or hazelnut have become popular in craft cocktail scenes.",

It is made from the agave plant, primarily the species Agave espadin, although other agave varieties can be used.

After roasting, the agave is crushed, fermented, and then distilled, resulting in a spirit with a wide range of flavors, including earthy, fruity, and herbal notes.\n\nThe traditional production methods involve cooking the agave in earthen pits lined with lava rocks and filled with wood and charcoal. This underground roasting process gives mezcal its distinctive smoky taste.\n\nMezcal is produced in specific regions of Mexico, with Oaxaca being a particularly renowned area for its high-quality mezcals. The production of mezcal is regulated, and the spirit has a Denomination of Origin (DO) to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\nUnlike some other agave spirits, such as tequila, which is made from Blue Agave, mezcal can be produced from a variety of agave types, contributing to the spirit's diversity.\n\nMezcal is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has gained international recognition for its artisanal production methods and diverse flavor profile.",

    "description": "The Paloma is about as easy as drinks get—and it should be easy drinking too. It’s a refreshing cooler of grapefruit soda and tequila, a combination that tastes best when brightened with a quick squeeze of fresh lime and grapefruit juice. (Don’t skip the garnish; the aroma is essential.) While there are modern versions of the Paloma recipe made exclusively with fresh juice, they require a sweetener, usually simple syrup, which adds an additional step; grapefruit soda is the traditional move, and it simplifies the method a bit.\n\nI’ve tested this drink with numerous sodas and my favorite is Ting, which has a spicy punch of grapefruit flavor that balances tequila well. Squirt and Jarritos Toronja are also classic choices. Different brands vary, so you may find you need to adjust the lime juice depending on the sweetness of your soda. Adding the soda at the beginning and the end of the process, rather than all at once, ensures the drink will mix easily; the less stirring, the more your highball will stay bubbly.\n\nBlanco tequila has fresh herbal flavors that aren’t hidden behind barrel aging; this isn’t the time to use a reposado tequila. But do pick a 100% agave option that’s good enough to sip on its own; there’s not a ton to hide behind here. I recommend 123 Blanco Organic Tequila Uno, Tequila Ocho, Tapatio Blanco, or Siembra Valles, among others. Mezcal Palomas are also delicious; the mezcal adds earthy richness and a touch of smoke. Wondering how to finish up a bottle? Check out our collections of tequila cocktails and mezcal cocktails.",

After roasting, the agave is crushed, fermented, and then distilled, resulting in a spirit with a wide range of flavors, including earthy, fruity, and herbal notes.\n\nThe traditional production methods involve cooking the agave in earthen pits lined with lava rocks and filled with wood and charcoal. This underground roasting process gives mezcal its distinctive smoky taste.\n\nMezcal is produced in specific regions of Mexico, with Oaxaca being a particularly renowned area for its high-quality mezcals. The production of mezcal is regulated, and the spirit has a Denomination of Origin (DO) to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\nUnlike some other agave spirits, such as tequila, which is made from Blue Agave, mezcal can be produced from a variety of agave types, contributing to the spirit's diversity.\n\nMezcal is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has gained international recognition for its artisanal production methods and diverse flavor profile.",

After roasting, the agave is crushed, fermented, and then distilled, resulting in a spirit with a wide range of flavors, including earthy, fruity, and herbal notes.\n\nThe traditional production methods involve cooking the agave in earthen pits lined with lava rocks and filled with wood and charcoal. This underground roasting process gives mezcal its distinctive smoky taste.\n\nMezcal is produced in specific regions of Mexico, with Oaxaca being a particularly renowned area for its high-quality mezcals. The production of mezcal is regulated, and the spirit has a Denomination of Origin (DO) to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\nUnlike some other agave spirits, such as tequila, which is made from Blue Agave, mezcal can be produced from a variety of agave types, contributing to the spirit's diversity.\n\nMezcal is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has gained international recognition for its artisanal production methods and diverse flavor profile.",

It is made from the agave plant, primarily the species Agave espadin, although other agave varieties can be used. The production of mezcal involves roasting the agave hearts (piñas) in underground pits, which imparts a smoky character to the final product. After roasting, the agave is crushed, fermented, and then distilled, resulting in a spirit with a wide range of flavors, including earthy, fruity, and herbal notes.\n\nThe traditional production methods involve cooking the agave in earthen pits lined with lava rocks and filled with wood and charcoal. This underground roasting process gives mezcal its distinctive smoky taste.\n\nMezcal is produced in specific regions of Mexico, with Oaxaca being a particularly renowned area for its high-quality mezcals. The production of mezcal is regulated, and the spirit has a Denomination of Origin (DO) to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\nUnlike some other agave spirits, such as tequila, which is made from Blue Agave, mezcal can be produced from a variety of agave types, contributing to the spirit's diversity.\n\nMezcal is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has gained international recognition for its artisanal production methods and diverse flavor profile.",

After distillation, brandy is often aged in wooden barrels, which contributes to its flavor, color, and aroma.\n\nThere are a few types of brandy:\n\n- V.S. (\"very special\") or ✯✯✯ (three stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy has been stored for at least two years in a cask.\n- V.S.O.P. (\"very superior old pale\"), Reserve or ✯✯✯✯✯ (five stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least four years in a cask.\n- XO (\"extra old\") or Napoléon designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least six years.\n- Hors d'âge ('beyond age') is a designation formally equal to XO for Cognac, but for Armagnac it designates brandy that is at least ten years old. In practice, the term is used by producers to market a high-quality product beyond the official age scale.\n\nBrandy has a rich history and is produced in many regions around the world, each with its own traditions and methods.

        "description": "Mezcal is a distilled alcoholic beverage that originates from Mexico, known for its distinctive smoky flavor. It is made from the agave plant, primarily the species Agave espadin, although other agave varieties can be used. The production of mezcal involves roasting the agave hearts (piñas) in underground pits, which imparts a smoky character to the final product. After roasting, the agave is crushed, fermented, and then distilled, resulting in a spirit with a wide range of flavors, including earthy, fruity, and herbal notes.\n\nThe traditional production methods involve cooking the agave in earthen pits lined with lava rocks and filled with wood and charcoal. This underground roasting process gives mezcal its distinctive smoky taste.\n\nMezcal is produced in specific regions of Mexico, with Oaxaca being a particularly renowned area for its high-quality mezcals. The production of mezcal is regulated, and the spirit has a Denomination of Origin (DO) to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\nUnlike some other agave spirits, such as tequila, which is made from Blue Agave, mezcal can be produced from a variety of agave types, contributing to the spirit's diversity.\n\nMezcal is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has gained international recognition for its artisanal production methods and diverse flavor profile.",

    "description": "The Wisconsin Old Fashioned is the state’s variation on the classic Old Fashioned cocktail, with brandy and lemon lime soda. The typical Old Fashioned recipe uses bourbon mixed with a muddled sugar cube and bitters. So where did the brandy Old Fashioned come from?\n\n\nHere’s the theory! (Per Jerry Minnich, at least.) A company of brothers debuted their Korbel brandy at the World’s Fair in 1893 in Chicago, which lots of Wisconsinites attended. A large percentage of Wisconsin at the time was German, and Germans preferred brandy over bourbon. Korbel brandy become a hit, and birthed this state’s funky variation on the classic cocktail. To this day, the drink is often served with Korbel brandy!\n\n\n- Sweet: Lemon lime soda (like 7 Up or Sprite). This is the default option at bars.\n- Sour: Sour mix or grapefruit soda (like Squirt).\n- Press: 50/50 lemon lime soda and soda water (club soda)\n- Soda: Soda water",

        "description": "Brandy is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented fruit juice, most commonly derived from wine. The fruit used can include grapes, apples, pears, or other fruits. The process of making brandy involves fermenting the fruit sugars into alcohol and then distilling the resulting liquid to increase its alcohol content. After distillation, brandy is often aged in wooden barrels, which contributes to its flavor, color, and aroma.\n\nThere are a few types of brandy:\n\n- V.S. (\"very special\") or ✯✯✯ (three stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy has been stored for at least two years in a cask.\n- V.S.O.P. (\"very superior old pale\"), Reserve or ✯✯✯✯✯ (five stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least four years in a cask.\n- XO (\"extra old\") or Napoléon designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least six years.\n- Hors d'âge ('beyond age') is a designation formally equal to XO for Cognac, but for Armagnac it designates brandy that is at least ten years old. In practice, the term is used by producers to market a high-quality product beyond the official age scale.\n\nBrandy has a rich history and is produced in many regions around the world, each with its own traditions and methods. The quality and characteristics of brandy can vary widely based on factors such as the type of fruit used, the distillation process, and the aging conditions.",

The production of gin involves distilling a neutral spirit with botanicals, with juniper being the key botanical required for a spirit to be classified as gin.\n\nThe defining characteristic of gin is the prominent presence of juniper berries in its flavor profile. The name \"gin\" is derived from the French word \"genièvre,\" meaning juniper.\n\nThere are several styles of gin, including London Dry Gin, Plymouth Gin, and New Western or Contemporary-style Gin. Each style has its own production methods and regulations.\n\nGin has a long history and has evolved over centuries, becoming one of the most popular and beloved spirits globally.

Superfine sugar is preferred for drinks like the Daiquiri or the Mojito, where it is muddled with lime or mint to create a balanced and refreshing flavor. Sugar cubes are a key component in classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned, where they are soaked in bitters before being muddled to release their sweetness.\n\nBeyond its role as a sweetener, sugar can also influence the texture and mouthfeel of a cocktail, adding a slight viscosity that enhances the drink's overall experience.

        "description": "Rye whiskey is a type of whiskey made primarily from rye grain. To be labeled as rye whiskey in the United States, the mash (grain mixture fermented to make alcohol) must be composed of at least 51% rye. The remaining ingredients in the mash can include other grains such as corn and barley. Rye whiskey is aged in new charred oak barrels, and the final product must be distilled to no more than 160 proof and entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof.\n\nAmerican rye whiskey tends to have a spicier and more robust flavor profile compared to bourbon, which is primarily made from corn.\n\nIn Canada, the term \"rye\" is often used broadly and doesn't necessarily mean that the whiskey is made predominantly from rye grain. Canadian rye whisky can contain a mix of grains, and the flavor profile may vary. Some Canadian whiskies labeled as \"rye\" are made with little or no rye content.\n\nRye whiskey is known for its distinctive taste, which can include spicy, fruity, and sometimes peppery notes. It can be enjoyed neat, on the rocks, or used in various cocktails such as the classic Manhattan or Old Fashioned.",

By blending these ingredients together, a delicious booze filled cocktail is brought to life.\n\nNotes of aged apples and pears are brought by the Calvados and then enriched by the botanicals of sweet vermouth. Gin contributes a healthy dose of juniper as well as a significant bite of alcohol. Final, modest, addition of yellow Chartreuse introduces a lot more herbal and botanical complexity as well as sweetness to the mix, nicely finishing the cocktail.\n\nThe Warday’s is a must try for seasoned cocktail enthusiasts.

The Margarita was named Esquire’s cocktail of the month in December 1953, and it has hardly flagged in popularity since, rising in stature alongside tequila, which got a pop-culture boost from the Eagles (“Tequila Sunrise”), Rolling Stones (the Cocaine and Tequila Sunrise Tour of ’72), and of course, Jimmy Buffet (“Margaritaville”).",

It is commonly used in cocktails as a mixer to add effervescence and a light, refreshing touch without altering the drink’s flavor profile significantly. The bubbles in club soda help to lift and blend the flavors of other ingredients, creating a more balanced and lively drink.\n\nIn cocktails, club soda is often used to top off drinks, adding volume and fizz. It's a key ingredient in classics like the Tom Collins, where it complements the gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup by adding a sparkling finish. It is also essential in making a Highball, where it dilutes the whiskey and adds a refreshing effervescence, or in a Mojito, where it lightens the mixture of rum, mint, lime, and sugar.\n\nClub soda is preferred over other carbonated waters like tonic water or seltzer when the goal is to add carbonation without additional flavors. Its clean, neutral taste makes it an ideal mixer for a wide range of cocktails, contributing to the drink’s texture and mouthfeel without overshadowing the primary ingredients.",

The campaign was headed by George Bednar, marketing director of McKesson, and a cartoon character was commissioned from graphic artist William J. \"Bill\" Young in Lima, New York, with the tagline that Bednar claimed to have penned: \"Harvey Wallbanger is the name. And I can be made!\". The Harvey Wallbanger character was a surfer, appearing in various ads during the campaign, and was mentioned in print as early as 1969, continuing into the 1970s.",

After roasting, the agave is crushed, fermented, and then distilled, resulting in a spirit with a wide range of flavors, including earthy, fruity, and herbal notes.\n\nThe traditional production methods involve cooking the agave in earthen pits lined with lava rocks and filled with wood and charcoal. This underground roasting process gives mezcal its distinctive smoky taste.\n\nMezcal is produced in specific regions of Mexico, with Oaxaca being a particularly renowned area for its high-quality mezcals. The production of mezcal is regulated, and the spirit has a Denomination of Origin (DO) to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\nUnlike some other agave spirits, such as tequila, which is made from Blue Agave, mezcal can be produced from a variety of agave types, contributing to the spirit's diversity.\n\nMezcal is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has gained international recognition for its artisanal production methods and diverse flavor profile.",

Distillation: Bourbon must be distilled to no more than 160 proof (80% alcohol by volume) and entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume).\n\n3. Barrel Aging: Bourbon must be aged in new charred oak barrels. There is no minimum aging requirement for bourbon, but to be labeled as \"straight bourbon,\" it must be aged for at least two years.\n\n4. No Additives: Bourbon must not contain any additives except water to adjust the proof.\n\n5. Bottling Strength: Bourbon must be bottled at a minimum of 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume).\n\n6. Geographic Origin: While bourbon can be produced anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with Kentucky, and many consider Kentucky bourbon to be a distinctive category.",

        "description": "Cognac is a high-quality French brandy produced in the Cognac region, located in the Charente department. It is renowned for its refined and complex flavor profile, resulting from a meticulous production process. Cognac is made exclusively from white grapes, primarily Ugni Blanc, Folle Blanche, and Colombard, which are fermented and distilled using traditional copper pot stills.\n\nCognac's aging process plays a crucial role in its development, as it absorbs characteristics from the oak barrels, contributing notes of vanilla, caramel, and spices. The region's unique maritime climate, with a mix of oceanic and continental influences, further enhances the maturation process.\n\nCognac is renowned for its smooth and elegant taste, with a harmonious balance of fruity, floral, and oaky elements. It is often enjoyed as a sipping spirit and is a key ingredient in classic cocktails like the Sidecar and Brandy Alexander. The production of Cognac is strictly regulated, ensuring that only spirits meeting specific criteria can bear the prestigious Cognac label.",

Despite its name, Angostura bitters does not contain angostura bark; instead, it features a proprietary combination of botanical ingredients.\n\nAngostura bitters typically comes in small bottles with a distinctive oversized label and a built-in dasher top, allowing for controlled and precise pouring.\n\nDespite the name, Angostura bitters is non-alcoholic in the sense that it is not consumed in large quantities and is used as a flavoring agent rather than a beverage on its own.\n\nAngostura bitters has become an iconic and essential ingredient in the world of cocktails, appreciated for its ability to elevate and enhance the overall drinking experience.",

        "description": "Club soda is a carbonated water that contains added minerals such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, and potassium sulfate, which give it a slightly salty and mineral-rich flavor. It is commonly used in cocktails as a mixer to add effervescence and a light, refreshing touch without altering the drink’s flavor profile significantly. The bubbles in club soda help to lift and blend the flavors of other ingredients, creating a more balanced and lively drink.\n\nIn cocktails, club soda is often used to top off drinks, adding volume and fizz. It's a key ingredient in classics like the Tom Collins, where it complements the gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup by adding a sparkling finish. It is also essential in making a Highball, where it dilutes the whiskey and adds a refreshing effervescence, or in a Mojito, where it lightens the mixture of rum, mint, lime, and sugar.\n\nClub soda is preferred over other carbonated waters like tonic water or seltzer when the goal is to add carbonation without additional flavors. Its clean, neutral taste makes it an ideal mixer for a wide range of cocktails, contributing to the drink’s texture and mouthfeel without overshadowing the primary ingredients.",

Ramos personally dictated that the drink be shaken for anywhere from two to twelve full minutes—depending on whom you ask—to achieve a fluffy, meringue-like texture. His bar, and many others of the day, achieved this yeoman’s task by creating bartender relays, where lines of “shaker men” would pull off the athletic endeavor. By 1915’s Mardi Gras season, the drink was so popular that Ramos needed thirty shaker men behind his bar. This stunningly gorgeous cocktail remains no easy task for modern drink makers, so today’s bartenders have begun utilizing paint shaker–like devices and whipped cream canisters as a sort of cheat. But if you have two strong arms, you can shake up a fine drink.",

After roasting, the agave is crushed, fermented, and then distilled, resulting in a spirit with a wide range of flavors, including earthy, fruity, and herbal notes.\n\nThe traditional production methods involve cooking the agave in earthen pits lined with lava rocks and filled with wood and charcoal. This underground roasting process gives mezcal its distinctive smoky taste.\n\nMezcal is produced in specific regions of Mexico, with Oaxaca being a particularly renowned area for its high-quality mezcals. The production of mezcal is regulated, and the spirit has a Denomination of Origin (DO) to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\nUnlike some other agave spirits, such as tequila, which is made from Blue Agave, mezcal can be produced from a variety of agave types, contributing to the spirit's diversity.\n\nMezcal is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has gained international recognition for its artisanal production methods and diverse flavor profile.",

Sugar can also be transformed into simple syrup, a liquid form that dissolves easily in cold beverages, making it a versatile option for many drinks.\n\nIn cocktails, sugar is often used to rim glasses, such as in a classic Margarita or a Sidecar, where the rim is coated with sugar to add sweetness with every sip. Superfine sugar is preferred for drinks like the Daiquiri or the Mojito, where it is muddled with lime or mint to create a balanced and refreshing flavor. Sugar cubes are a key component in classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned, where they are soaked in bitters before being muddled to release their sweetness.\n\nBeyond its role as a sweetener, sugar can also influence the texture and mouthfeel of a cocktail, adding a slight viscosity that enhances the drink's overall experience. Whether used in its solid form or as a syrup, sugar is an essential ingredient that helps create harmony and depth in a wide range of cocktails.",

After distillation, brandy is often aged in wooden barrels, which contributes to its flavor, color, and aroma.\n\nThere are a few types of brandy:\n\n- V.S. (\"very special\") or ✯✯✯ (three stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy has been stored for at least two years in a cask.\n- V.S.O.P. (\"very superior old pale\"), Reserve or ✯✯✯✯✯ (five stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least four years in a cask.\n- XO (\"extra old\") or Napoléon designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least six years.\n- Hors d'âge ('beyond age') is a designation formally equal to XO for Cognac, but for Armagnac it designates brandy that is at least ten years old. In practice, the term is used by producers to market a high-quality product beyond the official age scale.\n\nBrandy has a rich history and is produced in many regions around the world, each with its own traditions and methods.

        "description": "Club soda is a carbonated water that contains added minerals such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, and potassium sulfate, which give it a slightly salty and mineral-rich flavor. It is commonly used in cocktails as a mixer to add effervescence and a light, refreshing touch without altering the drink’s flavor profile significantly. The bubbles in club soda help to lift and blend the flavors of other ingredients, creating a more balanced and lively drink.\n\nIn cocktails, club soda is often used to top off drinks, adding volume and fizz. It's a key ingredient in classics like the Tom Collins, where it complements the gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup by adding a sparkling finish. It is also essential in making a Highball, where it dilutes the whiskey and adds a refreshing effervescence, or in a Mojito, where it lightens the mixture of rum, mint, lime, and sugar.\n\nClub soda is preferred over other carbonated waters like tonic water or seltzer when the goal is to add carbonation without additional flavors. Its clean, neutral taste makes it an ideal mixer for a wide range of cocktails, contributing to the drink’s texture and mouthfeel without overshadowing the primary ingredients.",

It is typically green in color, but clear variations also exist. Absinthe is renowned for its distinctive herbal and botanical profile, which often includes ingredients like wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), anise, fennel, and other herbs.\n\nThe production of absinthe involves macerating and distilling these botanicals to create a highly concentrated liquid. The key component, wormwood, was once believed to contain a compound called thujone, thought to induce hallucinations. However, modern absinthes are produced with strict regulations regarding thujone content, and the hallucinogenic effects of traditional absinthe are now considered to be largely exaggerated.\n\nAbsinthe is often served by diluting it with water, typically by pouring cold water over a sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon, which is then held over the glass. This process, known as the \"louche,\" causes the absinthe to cloud and release its herbal flavors.\n\nThe drink gained notoriety in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the bohemian and artistic communities of Europe. It was banned in many countries for a period due to concerns about its alleged psychoactive effects and its association with absinthe-induced madness. However, the ban has been lifted in most places, and today absinthe is produced and consumed legally with regulated thujone levels.\n\nAbsinthe has experienced a resurgence in popularity, and while its reputation as a mind-altering substance has been debunked, it is still enjoyed for its unique flavor and the ritualistic manner in which it is often served.",

        "description": "Brandy is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented fruit juice, most commonly derived from wine. The fruit used can include grapes, apples, pears, or other fruits. The process of making brandy involves fermenting the fruit sugars into alcohol and then distilling the resulting liquid to increase its alcohol content. After distillation, brandy is often aged in wooden barrels, which contributes to its flavor, color, and aroma.\n\nThere are a few types of brandy:\n\n- V.S. (\"very special\") or ✯✯✯ (three stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy has been stored for at least two years in a cask.\n- V.S.O.P. (\"very superior old pale\"), Reserve or ✯✯✯✯✯ (five stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least four years in a cask.\n- XO (\"extra old\") or Napoléon designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least six years.\n- Hors d'âge ('beyond age') is a designation formally equal to XO for Cognac, but for Armagnac it designates brandy that is at least ten years old. In practice, the term is used by producers to market a high-quality product beyond the official age scale.\n\nBrandy has a rich history and is produced in many regions around the world, each with its own traditions and methods. The quality and characteristics of brandy can vary widely based on factors such as the type of fruit used, the distillation process, and the aging conditions.",

        "description": "Absinthe is a highly alcoholic and anise-flavored spirit that is historically known for its association with bohemian culture and its supposed hallucinogenic properties. It is typically green in color, but clear variations also exist. Absinthe is renowned for its distinctive herbal and botanical profile, which often includes ingredients like wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), anise, fennel, and other herbs.\n\nThe production of absinthe involves macerating and distilling these botanicals to create a highly concentrated liquid. The key component, wormwood, was once believed to contain a compound called thujone, thought to induce hallucinations. However, modern absinthes are produced with strict regulations regarding thujone content, and the hallucinogenic effects of traditional absinthe are now considered to be largely exaggerated.\n\nAbsinthe is often served by diluting it with water, typically by pouring cold water over a sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon, which is then held over the glass. This process, known as the \"louche,\" causes the absinthe to cloud and release its herbal flavors.\n\nThe drink gained notoriety in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the bohemian and artistic communities of Europe. It was banned in many countries for a period due to concerns about its alleged psychoactive effects and its association with absinthe-induced madness. However, the ban has been lifted in most places, and today absinthe is produced and consumed legally with regulated thujone levels.\n\nAbsinthe has experienced a resurgence in popularity, and while its reputation as a mind-altering substance has been debunked, it is still enjoyed for its unique flavor and the ritualistic manner in which it is often served.",

The bubbles in club soda help to lift and blend the flavors of other ingredients, creating a more balanced and lively drink.\n\nIn cocktails, club soda is often used to top off drinks, adding volume and fizz. It's a key ingredient in classics like the Tom Collins, where it complements the gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup by adding a sparkling finish. It is also essential in making a Highball, where it dilutes the whiskey and adds a refreshing effervescence, or in a Mojito, where it lightens the mixture of rum, mint, lime, and sugar.\n\nClub soda is preferred over other carbonated waters like tonic water or seltzer when the goal is to add carbonation without additional flavors.

Grain Mash Composition: Bourbon must be made from a grain mash that is at least 51% corn. The remaining portion of the mash can include other grains such as barley, rye, and wheat.\n\n2. Distillation: Bourbon must be distilled to no more than 160 proof (80% alcohol by volume) and entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume).\n\n3. Barrel Aging: Bourbon must be aged in new charred oak barrels. There is no minimum aging requirement for bourbon, but to be labeled as \"straight bourbon,\" it must be aged for at least two years.\n\n4. No Additives: Bourbon must not contain any additives except water to adjust the proof.\n\n5. Bottling Strength: Bourbon must be bottled at a minimum of 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume).\n\n6. Geographic Origin: While bourbon can be produced anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with Kentucky, and many consider Kentucky bourbon to be a distinctive category.",

    "description": "Many themes surrounding innovation, industry, and culture have captured the imagination of bartenders; take for example the 20th Century or Blood and Sand. In this case, it is medicine that lent inspiration, as the monkey gland was named in honor of a procedure that gained quite a bit of attention in the 1920s. Pioneered by Dr. Serge Voronoff, the process involved transplanting a monkey's sexual gland tissue into humans, and carried the promise of “rejuvenation” in the form of youthful energy, prolonged life, and other various health claims. An increase in sexual ability was also implied, and undoubtedly a focus of interest. The practice of inserting monkey glands into millionaires' bodies fascinated the public, and references to the technique crept into popular culture—from film, to literature, to beverage culture—and resulted in this drink, which was created by bartender Harry McElhone in Paris. The drink was a hit among his bar patrons, who were often American expats. In his Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails, Ted Haigh goes so far as to label the monkey gland as the “cocktail most associated with Prohibition”. \n\nA simple mix of gin, orange, grenadine, and absinthe , this drink delivers a beautiful candy-orange color. However, the monkey gland has a bit of a reputation taste-wise: the ingredients don’t quite work together, and our experience with the drink was roughly the same. Anise and orange are odd bedfellows and it feels as though the absinthe never quite fits in with the other ingredients. The nose is full of orange and absinthe, followed by a fruity and herbal sip. The mixture results in a sweet tart flavor, almost candy like, with a juniper finish. It has the same overall roundness as other orange juice based drinks, such as the income tax or Blood and Sand, and the absinthe does shine in providing a sharpness that cuts through the roundness, which is a nice touch. \n\nThe drink is often mixed one of two ways: equal parts gin and orange juice (the classic ratio) or 2:1, which has become popular over time. Our tastes tend toward the modern, although the 1:1 ratio seems to more successfully smooth out the absinthe bumps. Some recipes use Benedictine in place of absinthe, likely from a little ingenuity during periods of absinthe unavailability. This does suit some tastes better, so it is worth trying. We understand why recipes call for a specific type of gin—this funky drink can definitely hinge on the variety selected. Many recipes recommend Plymouth gin for this—a directive we didn’t follow, but that could be good advice to adhere to, although in general a dry gin is what you want here. As always, use fresh orange juice. Some recipes suggest no garnish, which is fine, but we like a nice orange wedge on the rim for presentation.",

        "description": "Absinthe is a highly alcoholic and anise-flavored spirit that is historically known for its association with bohemian culture and its supposed hallucinogenic properties. It is typically green in color, but clear variations also exist. Absinthe is renowned for its distinctive herbal and botanical profile, which often includes ingredients like wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), anise, fennel, and other herbs.\n\nThe production of absinthe involves macerating and distilling these botanicals to create a highly concentrated liquid. The key component, wormwood, was once believed to contain a compound called thujone, thought to induce hallucinations. However, modern absinthes are produced with strict regulations regarding thujone content, and the hallucinogenic effects of traditional absinthe are now considered to be largely exaggerated.\n\nAbsinthe is often served by diluting it with water, typically by pouring cold water over a sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon, which is then held over the glass. This process, known as the \"louche,\" causes the absinthe to cloud and release its herbal flavors.\n\nThe drink gained notoriety in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the bohemian and artistic communities of Europe. It was banned in many countries for a period due to concerns about its alleged psychoactive effects and its association with absinthe-induced madness. However, the ban has been lifted in most places, and today absinthe is produced and consumed legally with regulated thujone levels.\n\nAbsinthe has experienced a resurgence in popularity, and while its reputation as a mind-altering substance has been debunked, it is still enjoyed for its unique flavor and the ritualistic manner in which it is often served.",

Popular red grape varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, and Syrah, among others. Red wine is known for its diverse flavor profiles and is often paired with a variety of foods.",

It comes in various forms, including granulated sugar, superfine sugar, and sugar cubes, each of which can be used differently depending on the cocktail. Sugar can also be transformed into simple syrup, a liquid form that dissolves easily in cold beverages, making it a versatile option for many drinks.\n\nIn cocktails, sugar is often used to rim glasses, such as in a classic Margarita or a Sidecar, where the rim is coated with sugar to add sweetness with every sip. Superfine sugar is preferred for drinks like the Daiquiri or the Mojito, where it is muddled with lime or mint to create a balanced and refreshing flavor. Sugar cubes are a key component in classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned, where they are soaked in bitters before being muddled to release their sweetness.\n\nBeyond its role as a sweetener, sugar can also influence the texture and mouthfeel of a cocktail, adding a slight viscosity that enhances the drink's overall experience. Whether used in its solid form or as a syrup, sugar is an essential ingredient that helps create harmony and depth in a wide range of cocktails.",

However, modern Amaretto is typically sweet rather than bitter.\n\nThe primary flavor in Amaretto comes from apricot pits or almonds, though today many commercial brands use a combination of both. The production process involves soaking the almonds or apricot pits in alcohol, which extracts their flavors. The resulting liquid is then sweetened with sugar, and sometimes flavored with vanilla or other spices.\n\nAmaretto is often enjoyed on its own as a digestif or as an ingredient in various cocktails and culinary recipes. It is a versatile liqueur that adds a rich and nutty flavor to beverages and desserts. Classic cocktails like the Amaretto Sour, as well as desserts like tiramisu, often feature this popular Italian liqueur.",

        "description": "Absinthe is a highly alcoholic and anise-flavored spirit that is historically known for its association with bohemian culture and its supposed hallucinogenic properties. It is typically green in color, but clear variations also exist. Absinthe is renowned for its distinctive herbal and botanical profile, which often includes ingredients like wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), anise, fennel, and other herbs.\n\nThe production of absinthe involves macerating and distilling these botanicals to create a highly concentrated liquid. The key component, wormwood, was once believed to contain a compound called thujone, thought to induce hallucinations. However, modern absinthes are produced with strict regulations regarding thujone content, and the hallucinogenic effects of traditional absinthe are now considered to be largely exaggerated.\n\nAbsinthe is often served by diluting it with water, typically by pouring cold water over a sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon, which is then held over the glass. This process, known as the \"louche,\" causes the absinthe to cloud and release its herbal flavors.\n\nThe drink gained notoriety in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the bohemian and artistic communities of Europe. It was banned in many countries for a period due to concerns about its alleged psychoactive effects and its association with absinthe-induced madness. However, the ban has been lifted in most places, and today absinthe is produced and consumed legally with regulated thujone levels.\n\nAbsinthe has experienced a resurgence in popularity, and while its reputation as a mind-altering substance has been debunked, it is still enjoyed for its unique flavor and the ritualistic manner in which it is often served.",

        "description": "Grapefruit juice is a bold and distinctive cocktail ingredient, known for its tart, bitter-sweet flavor profile. Extracted from the grapefruit, a citrus fruit larger and more acidic than oranges, this juice brings a complex taste that can range from bracingly sour to subtly sweet, depending on the variety of grapefruit used.\n\n\nIn cocktails, grapefruit juice adds a sophisticated and refreshing element. Its natural bitterness and acidity make it an excellent counterpoint to sweet liqueurs and spirits, creating well-balanced drinks. The juice also contributes a lovely pink or ruby hue to cocktails, enhancing their visual appeal.\nPopular in classics like the Paloma and the Greyhound, grapefruit juice pairs particularly well with tequila, vodka, and gin. When using grapefruit juice in cocktails, freshly squeezed is ideal for the brightest flavor, though high-quality bottled juices can be a convenient alternative. The amount used can vary, but its strong flavor means a little often goes a long way in cocktail recipes.",

Superfine sugar is preferred for drinks like the Daiquiri or the Mojito, where it is muddled with lime or mint to create a balanced and refreshing flavor. Sugar cubes are a key component in classic cocktails like the Old Fashioned, where they are soaked in bitters before being muddled to release their sweetness.\n\nBeyond its role as a sweetener, sugar can also influence the texture and mouthfeel of a cocktail, adding a slight viscosity that enhances the drink's overall experience.

It is typically green in color, but clear variations also exist. Absinthe is renowned for its distinctive herbal and botanical profile, which often includes ingredients like wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), anise, fennel, and other herbs.\n\nThe production of absinthe involves macerating and distilling these botanicals to create a highly concentrated liquid. The key component, wormwood, was once believed to contain a compound called thujone, thought to induce hallucinations. However, modern absinthes are produced with strict regulations regarding thujone content, and the hallucinogenic effects of traditional absinthe are now considered to be largely exaggerated.\n\nAbsinthe is often served by diluting it with water, typically by pouring cold water over a sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon, which is then held over the glass. This process, known as the \"louche,\" causes the absinthe to cloud and release its herbal flavors.\n\nThe drink gained notoriety in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the bohemian and artistic communities of Europe. It was banned in many countries for a period due to concerns about its alleged psychoactive effects and its association with absinthe-induced madness. However, the ban has been lifted in most places, and today absinthe is produced and consumed legally with regulated thujone levels.\n\nAbsinthe has experienced a resurgence in popularity, and while its reputation as a mind-altering substance has been debunked, it is still enjoyed for its unique flavor and the ritualistic manner in which it is often served.",

It falls under the category of distilled spirits and is known for its diverse and complex flavor profile, which can include herbal, floral, citrus, and spicy notes. The production of gin involves distilling a neutral spirit with botanicals, with juniper being the key botanical required for a spirit to be classified as gin.\n\nThe defining characteristic of gin is the prominent presence of juniper berries in its flavor profile. The name \"gin\" is derived from the French word \"genièvre,\" meaning juniper.\n\nThere are several styles of gin, including London Dry Gin, Plymouth Gin, and New Western or Contemporary-style Gin. Each style has its own production methods and regulations.\n\nGin has a long history and has evolved over centuries, becoming one of the most popular and beloved spirits globally.

Absinthe is renowned for its distinctive herbal and botanical profile, which often includes ingredients like wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), anise, fennel, and other herbs.\n\nThe production of absinthe involves macerating and distilling these botanicals to create a highly concentrated liquid. The key component, wormwood, was once believed to contain a compound called thujone, thought to induce hallucinations. However, modern absinthes are produced with strict regulations regarding thujone content, and the hallucinogenic effects of traditional absinthe are now considered to be largely exaggerated.\n\nAbsinthe is often served by diluting it with water, typically by pouring cold water over a sugar cube placed on a slotted spoon, which is then held over the glass. This process, known as the \"louche,\" causes the absinthe to cloud and release its herbal flavors.\n\nThe drink gained notoriety in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly in the bohemian and artistic communities of Europe. It was banned in many countries for a period due to concerns about its alleged psychoactive effects and its association with absinthe-induced madness. However, the ban has been lifted in most places, and today absinthe is produced and consumed legally with regulated thujone levels.\n\nAbsinthe has experienced a resurgence in popularity, and while its reputation as a mind-altering substance has been debunked, it is still enjoyed for its unique flavor and the ritualistic manner in which it is often served.",

The region's unique maritime climate, with a mix of oceanic and continental influences, further enhances the maturation process.\n\nCognac is renowned for its smooth and elegant taste, with a harmonious balance of fruity, floral, and oaky elements.

        "description": "Grapefruit juice is a bold and distinctive cocktail ingredient, known for its tart, bitter-sweet flavor profile. Extracted from the grapefruit, a citrus fruit larger and more acidic than oranges, this juice brings a complex taste that can range from bracingly sour to subtly sweet, depending on the variety of grapefruit used.\n\n\nIn cocktails, grapefruit juice adds a sophisticated and refreshing element. Its natural bitterness and acidity make it an excellent counterpoint to sweet liqueurs and spirits, creating well-balanced drinks. The juice also contributes a lovely pink or ruby hue to cocktails, enhancing their visual appeal.\nPopular in classics like the Paloma and the Greyhound, grapefruit juice pairs particularly well with tequila, vodka, and gin. When using grapefruit juice in cocktails, freshly squeezed is ideal for the brightest flavor, though high-quality bottled juices can be a convenient alternative. The amount used can vary, but its strong flavor means a little often goes a long way in cocktail recipes.",

It is made from the agave plant, primarily the species Agave espadin, although other agave varieties can be used. The production of mezcal involves roasting the agave hearts (piñas) in underground pits, which imparts a smoky character to the final product. After roasting, the agave is crushed, fermented, and then distilled, resulting in a spirit with a wide range of flavors, including earthy, fruity, and herbal notes.\n\nThe traditional production methods involve cooking the agave in earthen pits lined with lava rocks and filled with wood and charcoal. This underground roasting process gives mezcal its distinctive smoky taste.\n\nMezcal is produced in specific regions of Mexico, with Oaxaca being a particularly renowned area for its high-quality mezcals. The production of mezcal is regulated, and the spirit has a Denomination of Origin (DO) to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\nUnlike some other agave spirits, such as tequila, which is made from Blue Agave, mezcal can be produced from a variety of agave types, contributing to the spirit's diversity.\n\nMezcal is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has gained international recognition for its artisanal production methods and diverse flavor profile.",

It is commonly used in cocktails as a mixer to add effervescence and a light, refreshing touch without altering the drink’s flavor profile significantly. The bubbles in club soda help to lift and blend the flavors of other ingredients, creating a more balanced and lively drink.\n\nIn cocktails, club soda is often used to top off drinks, adding volume and fizz. It's a key ingredient in classics like the Tom Collins, where it complements the gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup by adding a sparkling finish. It is also essential in making a Highball, where it dilutes the whiskey and adds a refreshing effervescence, or in a Mojito, where it lightens the mixture of rum, mint, lime, and sugar.\n\nClub soda is preferred over other carbonated waters like tonic water or seltzer when the goal is to add carbonation without additional flavors. Its clean, neutral taste makes it an ideal mixer for a wide range of cocktails, contributing to the drink’s texture and mouthfeel without overshadowing the primary ingredients.",

These are just constructed and mixed in a standard rocks glass or whatever you’re drinking from, and requires no additional equipment to stir, shake, or strain.\n\nNot only is it ultra simple with fewer things to wash, the extra potency to start sets the mood and anchors your palate for the rest of the drink as you slowly sip. I personally looove the super spirit-forward libations, and this intensity actually helps keep me from drinking it too quickly (often a problem for me for cocktails!). Something about the more rustic nature of it compared to a carefully chilled stirred&strained cocktail just really hits the spot for me.",

Cognac is made exclusively from white grapes, primarily Ugni Blanc, Folle Blanche, and Colombard, which are fermented and distilled using traditional copper pot stills.\n\nCognac's aging process plays a crucial role in its development, as it absorbs characteristics from the oak barrels, contributing notes of vanilla, caramel, and spices.

        "description": "Club soda is a carbonated water that contains added minerals such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, and potassium sulfate, which give it a slightly salty and mineral-rich flavor. It is commonly used in cocktails as a mixer to add effervescence and a light, refreshing touch without altering the drink’s flavor profile significantly. The bubbles in club soda help to lift and blend the flavors of other ingredients, creating a more balanced and lively drink.\n\nIn cocktails, club soda is often used to top off drinks, adding volume and fizz. It's a key ingredient in classics like the Tom Collins, where it complements the gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup by adding a sparkling finish. It is also essential in making a Highball, where it dilutes the whiskey and adds a refreshing effervescence, or in a Mojito, where it lightens the mixture of rum, mint, lime, and sugar.\n\nClub soda is preferred over other carbonated waters like tonic water or seltzer when the goal is to add carbonation without additional flavors. Its clean, neutral taste makes it an ideal mixer for a wide range of cocktails, contributing to the drink’s texture and mouthfeel without overshadowing the primary ingredients.",
